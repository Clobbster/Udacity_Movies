Hello and welcome to my first Udacity project. 
03/04/2018


CONTENTS:

1. Images folder: Contains a list of images that I've used for some movies that I've selected for this project.

2. entertainment_center.py: Contains path information to the images directory, class instances and ties everything to "fresh_tomatoes.html".

3. fresh_tomatoes.html and .py: Contains the formatting and styling of the webpage and was provided by Udacity for use. Contains open_movies_page() calling the .html page.

4. media.py: Contains the classes to be used in this program. Currently it has the "Movie" class used to build each movie in "entertainment_center.py".  



HOW TO USE:

This program is intended to be downloaded to the local machine and can be run a few ways. If python is installed, you can call the "entertainment_center.py" via the command line. Alternatively, you can just execute the .html file via the command line or GUI.
